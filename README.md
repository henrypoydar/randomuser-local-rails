# Random User / Local

I love the API at http://api.randomuser.me. However for some offline demos in some Rails apps I needed a local cache. This Rails plugin provides a local version of some of the data (basic US male and female profiles) generated by external calls to the API.

Uses the US data here: https://github.com/RandomAPI/Randomuser.me-Data

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'randomuser-local'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install randomuser-local

## Usage

Grab the a single random user, returned as a hash:

    RandomuserLocal.generate

Multiple random users:

    RandomuserLocal.generate(5)

A single female random user:

    RandomuserLocal.generate_female

Multiple female random users:

    RandomuserLocal.generate_female(5)

A single male random user:

    RandomuserLocal.generate_male

Multiple male random users:

    RandomuserLocal.generate_male(5)
